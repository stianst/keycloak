# File patterns used to decide what workflows/jobs to execute for a given PR
#
# To test a pattern run '.github/actions/conditional/conditional.sh <remote name> <branch>'
# Alternatively, run 'git diff <remote name>/<branch> <pattern>' (from the root directory)
#
# Note: The file needs to end with an empty line, otherwise last pattern is not picked up
